# JWT_Authentication
A little example to illustrate how JWT is implemented for stateless auth

This example is 100% functional and could be used as a starting point to set up the authentication service in any kind of micro service architecture.
A JWT is generated for each request with successful authentication. Each JWT has a lifespan, which can be tuned up based on other input and functional needs.

Additional snippets are added to illustrate some basic techniques for Java Devs.


Feel free to re-use the code.

Hope you Enjoy it.
